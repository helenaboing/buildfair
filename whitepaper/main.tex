\title{BuildFair: Construction Contract with Jury}
\author{BuildFair Team}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
BuildFair is a smart contract solution for the construction industry that ensures smooth relationships between buyers, sellers, and jurors. It provides transparency, milestone tracking, and a built-in dispute resolution system, making construction agreements transparent, fair, and secure.
\end{abstract}

\section{Overview}
BuildFair ensures that payments are only made once milestones are achieved and provides a jury system to resolve disputes. This eliminates grey areas and establishes clear, trusted agreements between parties.

\section{Features}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Buyer:} Funds the contract and approves completed work
    \item \textbf{Seller:} Marks milestones as completed and receives payments once verified
    \item \textbf{Jury:} A neutral party who steps in if there's a dispute, helping to resolve any issues fairly
\end{itemize}

\section{Roles}
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Role} & \textbf{Description} \\
\midrule
Buyer & The one funding the project and verifying if the work is completed \\
Seller & The one doing the hard work and completing the construction milestones \\
Jury & The trusted third-party mediator who settles any disputes \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Contract States}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Created:} The contract is created, but not yet funded
    \item \textbf{Funded:} The buyer has funded the contract
    \item \textbf{InProgress:} The seller has marked a milestone as completed, and the buyer is reviewing it
    \item \textbf{Completed:} The milestone is approved, and payment is made
    \item \textbf{Disputed:} A dispute is raisedâ€”time for the jury to step in
    \item \textbf{Closed:} The contract is completed or resolved, and the funds are disbursed
\end{itemize}

\section{Functions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{fundContract()}: The buyer funds the contract
    \item \texttt{markMilestoneCompleted()}: The seller marks a milestone as complete
    \item \texttt{approveMilestone()}: The buyer approves the milestone and makes a payment
    \item \texttt{raiseDispute()}: Either party can raise a dispute if something's not right
    \item \texttt{resolveDispute()}: The jury resolves the dispute and decides who gets the money
    \item \texttt{endContract()}: The contract ends, either by successful completion or dispute resolution
\end{itemize}

\section{Deployment Guide}

\subsection{Prerequisites}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Solidity version 0.8.0 or higher
    \item Ethereum Wallet: MetaMask or another wallet to interact with the contract
    \item Ethereum Node: A test network (e.g., Rinkeby, Goerli) or mainnet
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Deployment Steps}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Install Dependencies}
    
    Install Truffle or Hardhat for deployment:
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
npm install -g truffle
# or
npm install --save-dev hardhat
    \end{lstlisting}

    \item \textbf{Create the Contract}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Add the smart contract code in the \texttt{contracts/} directory
        \item Example: \texttt{contracts/ConstructionContract.sol}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Deploy the Contract}
    
    Using Truffle:
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript]
const ConstructionContract = artifacts.require("ConstructionContract");

module.exports = function (deployer) {
  deployer.deploy(ConstructionContract, sellerAddress, juryAddress, 
    contractAmount, milestoneAmount);
};
    \end{lstlisting}

    Using Hardhat:
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript]
async function main() {
  const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();
  const ConstructionContract = await ethers.getContractFactory(
    "ConstructionContract"
  );

  const contract = await ConstructionContract.deploy(
    sellerAddress, juryAddress, contractAmount, milestoneAmount
  );
  console.log("Contract deployed to:", contract.address);
}

main();
    \end{lstlisting}

    \item \textbf{Interact with the Contract}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use Web3.js or Ethers.js to interact with the contract once deployed
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Example Use Case}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Buyer funds the contract with 10 ETH
    \item Seller completes the first milestone
    \item Buyer approves the milestone and pays the seller 2 ETH
    \item If the Seller disagrees or there's a problem, a dispute is raised
    \item The Jury resolves the dispute and decides who gets the funds
\end{enumerate}

\section{Security Considerations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Make sure your jury is a trusted party who can resolve disputes fairly
    \item Verify milestones carefully to avoid conflicts or fraudulent claims
    \item Gas Fees: Be mindful of the Ethereum gas costs when deploying and interacting with the contract on the blockchain
\end{itemize}

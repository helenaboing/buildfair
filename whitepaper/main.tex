\section{Introduction}
The European construction sector, a cornerstone of the European economy, faces persistent challenges, particularly for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). While representing a significant market opportunity (€840 billion serviceable available market\cite{nextmsc_analysis}), SMEs in construction often grapple with issues that hinder growth and efficiency. Among the most pressing are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Pervasive Payment Delays:} Late payments are a notorious problem in the construction industry, disproportionately impacting SME cash flow and financial stability. Industry reports indicate average payment delays of 60-90 days for European construction SMEs\cite{construction_standards}, severely straining their resources and ability to undertake new projects.
    \item \textbf{Lack of Trust and Transparency:} Construction projects often involve complex, multi-stage agreements and relationships between buyers and sellers. A lack of transparency in project progress and payment status can breed distrust, leading to disputes and inefficiencies\cite{european_market_report}.
    \item \textbf{Inefficient and Costly Dispute Resolution:} When disagreements arise regarding project scope, quality, or payment, traditional dispute resolution mechanisms are often slow, expensive, and adversarial. This process can be particularly damaging for SMEs with limited resources.
    \item \textbf{Complex and Fragmented Payment Processes:} The industry often relies on complex, multi-step payment structures that can be difficult to manage and track, leading to errors and delays.
    \item \textbf{Lack of Standardization:} The construction industry lacks standardized payment terms and procedures, leading to confusion and potential disputes.
\end{itemize}

These challenges are exacerbated by the industry's reliance on intermediaries, such as banks and financial institutions, which often impose high fees and strict regulations that can hinder SME growth and innovation.

\subsection{Introducing BuildFair}
BuildFair is a decentralized protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain that directly tackles these pain points. By leveraging the security and transparency of blockchain technology and the automation capabilities of smart contracts, BuildFair offers a revolutionary solution for creating, managing, and executing construction agreements.

\subsection{Core Value Proposition}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Secure and Automated Payments:} Smart contracts automatically manage and release payments based on pre-defined project milestones or completion criteria, eliminating payment delays\cite{construction_standards} and ensuring fair compensation for sellers.
    \item \textbf{Enhanced Transparency and Trust:} All agreement terms, project milestones, and payment transactions are recorded immutably on the blockchain\cite{ethereum_yellow}, providing unparalleled transparency and building trust between buyers and sellers.
    \item \textbf{Increased Efficiency and Reduced Costs:} Automating contract management and payment processes minimizes administrative overhead, freeing up valuable time and resources\cite{european_market_report}.
    \item \textbf{Fair and Impartial Dispute Resolution:} Future development will include a decentralized jury system for efficient and impartial dispute resolution.
\end{itemize}

\section{Protocol Overview}
\subsection{Core Components}
BuildFair operates as a decentralized protocol comprised of three main components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Smart Contracts:} The heart of the BuildFair protocol resides in its suite of Ethereum smart contracts. These contracts define the logic for project creation, funding, milestone management, payment release, and role-based access control.
    \item \textbf{BuildFair Platform Interface (DApp):} A user-friendly web interface allows buyers and sellers to interact with the BuildFair protocol, managing projects and payments through interaction with the underlying smart contracts.
    \item \textbf{Ethereum Blockchain:} BuildFair is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, leveraging its robust security, decentralization, and established ecosystem.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Features}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Decentralized and Trustless Agreements:} Eliminates intermediaries and central authorities, with agreements governed by code.
    \item \textbf{Automated Milestone-Based Payments:} Future enhancement to enable automatic payment release upon milestone completion.
    \item \textbf{Transparent and Immutable Records:} All project details and transactions are permanently recorded on the blockchain.
    \item \textbf{Role-Based Access Control:} Clear separation of buyer and seller permissions.
    \item \textbf{Secure Escrow Mechanism:} Project funds are held securely until work completion is verified.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Flows}
BuildFair is designed to streamline the agreement process for both buyers and sellers in construction projects. The core user flows are as follows:

\subsubsection{Project Creation Flow (Seller Initiated)}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
    \item \textbf{Seller Initiates Project:} Using the BuildFair Platform, the Seller initiates a new project, specifying the Buyer's Ethereum address, the agreed-upon project amount (in ETH), and a detailed description of the project scope and terms.
    
    \item \textbf{Smart Contract Deployment:} The BuildFair platform interacts with the underlying smart contract to create a new Project instance on the blockchain, recording the project details and associating it with the specified Buyer and Seller addresses. The smart contract assigns a unique projectId to this new project.
    
    \item \textbf{Project Details Recorded:} All project details, including buyer and seller addresses, project amount, and description, are immutably recorded on the Ethereum blockchain within the newly created Project smart contract.
    
    \item \textbf{Project Creation Confirmation:} The Seller and Buyer receive confirmation of successful project creation through the BuildFair Platform.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Project Funding Flow (Buyer Initiated)}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
    \item \textbf{Buyer Reviews Project Details:} The Buyer reviews the project details on the BuildFair Platform, ensuring they align with the agreed-upon terms.
    
    \item \textbf{Buyer Funds Project:} The Buyer uses the BuildFair Platform to initiate the funding process for the specific projectId. The platform guides the Buyer to deposit the exact agreed-upon ETH amount into the designated Project smart contract address.
    
    \item \textbf{Funds Secured in Escrow:} The deposited ETH is securely held in escrow within the Project smart contract. The contract verifies that the correct amount has been received and updates the project status to "Funded".
    
    \item \textbf{Funding Confirmation:} Both Buyer and Seller receive confirmation that the project has been successfully funded and that the funds are securely held in escrow.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Work Verification and Payment Release Flow (Buyer Initiated)}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
    \item \textbf{Seller Completes Work (Off-Chain):} The Seller performs the agreed-upon construction work as per the project agreement, working off-chain.
    
    \item \textbf{Buyer Verifies Work Completion:} Upon project completion, the Buyer verifies that the work has been completed to their satisfaction, based on agreed-upon criteria (inspections, documentation, etc. – these verification methods are agreed upon off-chain as part of the project terms).
    
    \item \textbf{Buyer Initiates Payment Release:} If satisfied with the completed work, the Buyer uses the BuildFair Platform to initiate the payment release for the specific projectId.
    
    \item \textbf{Smart Contract Executes Payment Release:} The BuildFair platform triggers the endProject function in the Project smart contract. The smart contract verifies that the project is in the "Funded" state and then automatically releases the funds held in escrow to the Seller's Ethereum address. The project status is updated to "Ended".
    
    \item \textbf{Payment Confirmation:} Both Buyer and Seller receive confirmation of successful payment distribution through the BuildFair Platform.
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

\section{Architecture}
\subsection{Smart Contract Design}
The BuildFair protocol's core logic is implemented through a set of robust and secure smart contracts written in Solidity, the primary smart contract language for Ethereum. These contracts are designed to be modular, auditable, and upgradeable where possible.

Key aspects of the smart contract design include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Project Contract:} This central smart contract manages the lifecycle of each construction project. It stores project details (buyer, seller, amount, description, status), enforces role-based access control, manages escrow functionality, and orchestrates payment release upon project completion.
    \item \textbf{Escrow Functionality:} The Project contract incorporates a secure escrow mechanism. When a project is funded, the Buyer's funds are transferred to and held securely within the Project contract itself. The funds remain locked in the contract until the endProject function is successfully executed by the Buyer after work verification.
    \item \textbf{State Management:} The contracts utilize a clear state management system (ProjectStatus enum) to track the different stages of a project (Created, Funded, Ended). State transitions are carefully controlled and verified within the smart contract functions to ensure predictable and secure contract behavior.
    \item \textbf{Custom Error Handling:} The smart contracts include custom error handling logic to provide informative error messages in case of failures or invalid operations. This enhances debugging and provides clearer feedback to users interacting with the protocol.
    \item \textbf{Gas Optimization:} Smart contract code is written with gas optimization principles in mind to minimize transaction costs for users interacting with the BuildFair protocol on the Ethereum network.
\end{itemize}

The BuildFair smart contracts are developed using industry-standard development tools such as Hardhat and are rigorously tested to ensure robustness and security. Prior to mainnet deployment, the smart contracts will undergo comprehensive security audits by reputable blockchain security firms to identify and mitigate any potential vulnerabilities.

\subsection{Role-Based Access Control}
BuildFair implements role-based access control within its smart contracts to ensure that only authorized parties can perform specific actions. The protocol defines two primary roles:

\subsubsection{Buyer}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Permissions:} Buyers are authorized to fund projects by depositing ETH into the escrow, and to trigger payment release to the Seller upon verifying satisfactory work completion using the endProject function.
    \item \textbf{Responsibility:} Buyers are responsible for reviewing project details, funding the project according to the agreed amount, and verifying the completion of work before releasing payment.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Seller}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Permissions:} Sellers are authorized to initiate project creation using the createProject function, specifying project details. They are also entitled to receive payments from the escrow upon successful work verification and payment release by the Buyer.
    \item \textbf{Responsibility:} Sellers are responsible for initiating project creation with accurate details, performing the agreed-upon construction work off-chain, and ensuring project completion according to the agreed terms.
\end{itemize}

\section{Technical Implementation}

    \item Returns: projectId, buyer, seller, amount, status, details
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data Structures}
The contract utilizes two primary data structures:

\textbf{Project Struct:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{projectId} (uint256): Unique project identifier
    \item \texttt{buyer} (address): Buyer's Ethereum address
    \item \texttt{seller} (address): Seller's Ethereum address
    \item \texttt{amount} (uint256): Project amount in Wei
    \item \texttt{status} (ProjectStatus): Current project state

    \item Funded: State after Buyer deposits funds
    \item Ended: Final state after payment release
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Key Logic Highlights}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Event Emission:} Each core function emits events for blockchain logging and external system integration
    \item \textbf{Escrow Implementation:} Smart contract acts as trustless escrow, holding funds until work verification
    \item \textbf{Role and State Enforcement:} Strict access control and state transition verification ensure secure execution
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Project Lifecycle}
The BuildFair project lifecycle encompasses the following stages:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Project Creation (Seller Initiated):} The Seller initiates a new project through the BuildFair Platform, providing the Buyer's Ethereum address, project amount, and detailed project specifications. This action triggers the createProject smart contract function, deploying a new Project instance on the blockchain and recording the project's initial state as "Created."
    
    \item \textbf{Project Funding (Buyer Initiated):} Upon reviewing the project details, the Buyer funds the project by depositing the exact agreed-upon ETH amount into the Project smart contract address via the BuildFair Platform. This action invokes the fundProject smart contract function, which verifies the correct amount and updates the project status to "Funded," securing the funds in escrow.
    
    \item \textbf{Work Execution (Off-Chain):} The Seller performs the agreed-upon construction work off-chain, adhering to the project specifications and timelines agreed upon with the Buyer. BuildFair does not directly manage or monitor the off-chain work execution phase.
    
    \item \textbf{Work Verification (Buyer Initiated):} Once the Seller declares the project complete, the Buyer verifies the work based on pre-agreed criteria. This verification process occurs off-chain and is crucial for ensuring buyer satisfaction before payment release.
    
    \item \textbf{Payment Distribution (Buyer Initiated):} If the Buyer is satisfied with the completed work, they initiate payment release through the BuildFair Platform. This action calls the endProject smart contract function. The smart contract automatically releases the funds held in escrow to the Seller's Ethereum address and updates the project status to "Ended," completing the on-chain project lifecycle.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Security Considerations}
\subsection{Smart Contract Security}
BuildFair prioritizes security at every level of its design and implementation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Custom Error Handling:} BuildFair smart contracts employ custom error handling logic and informative error messages, providing clear feedback to users and developers when unexpected issues occur.
    
    \item \textbf{Role-Based Access Control:} Smart contract functions that modify contract state are protected by modifier checks, ensuring that only authorized users can execute critical functions.
    
    \item \textbf{State Transition Verification:} The contracts implement state transition verification to ensure that project lifecycles progress logically and predictably, preventing unexpected function calls in incorrect states.
    
    \item \textbf{Secure Fund Handling:} BuildFair utilizes a secure escrow mechanism where project funds are held directly within the Project smart contract, with carefully controlled fund transfers.
    
    \item \textbf{Reentrancy Protection:} The contracts are designed with reentrancy protection measures embedded in their state management logic, preventing potential recursive call exploits.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Security Enhancements}
BuildFair is committed to continuous security improvement and plans to implement:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Formal Verification:} Exploring formal verification techniques to mathematically prove the correctness and security properties of the smart contracts.
    
    \item \textbf{Decentralized Oracles:} For future features requiring integration with off-chain data sources, BuildFair will explore secure, decentralized oracles.
    
    \item \textbf{Continuous Monitoring:} Implementing continuous monitoring and vulnerability scanning tools for proactive security management.

\subsection{Revenue Model}
BuildFair generates revenue through the following mechanisms:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Transaction Fee:} A 2\% transaction fee is levied on each successful project transaction facilitated through the BuildFair protocol. This fee is calculated as 2\% of the project amount and is automatically deducted from the escrowed funds before payment release to the Seller. A minimum transaction fee of 0.01 ETH is applied to ensure economic viability for smaller transactions and cover gas costs associated with smart contract execution.
    
    The transaction fee is justified by the significant value BuildFair provides:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Enhanced security and transparency
        \item Automation of payments
        \item Reduced risk of disputes
        \item Cost-effective compared to traditional project management
    \end{itemize}
    
    These fees fund ongoing protocol development, maintenance, security audits, community support, and platform infrastructure.
    
    \item \textbf{Subscription Plans (Future Feature):} Premium subscription plans targeted towards business users will unlock:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Advanced project management tools
        \item Reporting dashboards
        \item API access with higher usage limits
